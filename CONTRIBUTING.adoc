Feel free to use the https://github.com/asciidoctor/atom-language-asciidoc/issues[issue tracker] to provide feedback or suggestions in other ways.

== Development

*todo*

=== Retrieve the source code

The source code for this plugin is available from https://github.com/asciidoctor/atom-language-asciidoc


=== Prepare for business

== Quality assurance

When opening a pull request on GitHub, https://travis-ci.org/asciidoctor/atom-language-asciidoc[Travis CI] will run the Atom package specs and lint using CoffeeScript files.
Of course you can do so yourself, so you can ensure your code will pass the check in the pull-request.

=== CoffeeScript lint

This package uses http://www.coffeelint.org/[CoffeeLint] to ensure that the code is uniformly structured.
The linter definitions are defined in the link:coffeelint.json[coffeelint.json].

When developing in Atom, the https://atom.io/packages/linter-coffeelint[linter-coffeelint] package exposes the linting in your editor.
It does require CoffeeLint to be http://www.coffeelint.org/#install[installed].

CoffeeLint can also be triggered from the command line:

[source, shell]
----
coffeelint -f coffeelint.json grammars/asciidoc.cson spec/*-spec.coffee snippets/language-asciidoc.cson
----

=== Package specs

Tests are defined in link:spec/asciidoc-spec.coffee[asciidoc-spec.coffee], which provide snippets of text and test if the parsed result meet the expectations.
Ideally all grammar features are covered in the specs (100% test coverage), with both positive and negative tests.
Having these tests present will help future contributors make improvements without accidentally breaking other parts of the package.

== Grammar

The grammar is defined in link:grammars/asciidoc.cson[grammars/asciidoc.cson].

=== Language definition

The Atom language definitions originate from the language definitions used for TextMate.
It supports both single matches based on a single regex, and sections matches based on a _begin_ and _end_ regex.
The regexes are based on Ruby.

=== Code language support

AsciiDoc offers the ability to include source code blocks, in a variety of languages.
By including the language definitions of the language set for the code block, AsciiDoc is able to offer code block language highlighting.
To get the most of out of this feature, development will have to keep up with languages available in Atom.
You can check the available source languages available in your Atom editor, to see if some language support is missing.

.Check source language support
. Open the _Developer Tools_: `Ctrl+Shift+I` on Linux and Windows, `Cmd+Alt+i` on Mac OS X.
. Run the query `Object.keys(atom.grammars.grammarsByScopeName).sort().join('\n')` in the _Console_.
